# PDF page range extractor

A Python application with a very simple graphical interface for extracting specific page ranges from PDF files. 
I was facing the problem of wanting to print some book chapters from a 900+ pages book and since my printer 
<img src="herta cool.gif" alt="<3" align= "left" width="30%" height="40%">can't flip pages I have to print the odd pages first in a bunch then the even pages on the back, I found it too troublesome to be writing that like 40 times so this simple app lets me select the pages of the chapters by simply get the ranges of the pages and print the odd and even pages quicker xd it may have other applications like just cutting the pdf to what matters to you ... also I didn't bother myself with searching if something like this exists, but it propbably does :> lol
